Approach:
I first understood the task properly and analyzed everything that is needed for the task. 

I started the task by following the setup instructions given in the task then i  learned about the topics required for the task from the resources and links given there.

The setting up part was easy to do but after that the implementation of core commands was the difficult part for me ,I had to learn how to implement the core commands and how does this everything works.I implemented /track using MusicBrainzAPI, /lyrics using LRClibAPI, /playlist using python dictionaries and also a /help command.

A lot of new stuffs was learnt by me in just one stretch and then i was able to push through everything and completed this task. The happiness i got after completing this task was next-level.

This task was really interesting just as it sounded and i really had fun doing this task with my Lyriclounge_bot.
