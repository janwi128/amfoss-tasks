# Approach:
first i leraned about the basics of MySQL,database,pyside6 from the resources given there, then i cloned the task task first into my system and followed the instructions given in the task like creating the virtual environment and installing dependencies. 
I tried to understand the task properly and worked on it step by step by understanding everything.

I struggled with the code writing and modifying the dashboard.py part but then i pushed through it and successfully completed the task.

This task was really good.I learned a lot along this task and I really enjoyed doing this task except from the error handling part.
