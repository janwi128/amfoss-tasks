# APPROACH:
When i first saw the task, i understood it was about creating simplified versions of common unix commands in C.
At the beginning i was not sure will i be able to do it or not as i don't have much knowledge about C language.

Then i thought i need to learn this and do this task in these final days.
My first step was to break the problem into smaller parts and learn each concept one by one.

I was successfully able to build all 4 commands with their simplified versions.
I could not implement the flags in these commands as there was no time remaining.
But not stopping here for sure.
