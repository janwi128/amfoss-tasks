#Mine gold

problem statement: Will Rohan and his friends together be able to carry up all the gold from the gold mine assuming that they can go to the mine exactly once.

Approach: total capacity= (n+1)*y total gold = x kg 
if total capacity>= x print("YES") else print ("NO").

code: 
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    N,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    total_capacity=(N+1)*Y
    if total_capacity>=X:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
