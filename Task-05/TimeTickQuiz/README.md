# How i Approached the problem:
 I first read everything which was given in the task.
I understood the requirements of the quiz game:questions,responses and timing.
I planned about which modules to use: requests = fetch quiz questions from APIs
json = handle question/answer data
time = implement countdown timer
threading = run timer and input and simultaneously
I set up a virtual environment and wrote the code step by step.

# What I Have Learnt
how to set up and use a python virtual environment(venv)
how to install packages using pip(requests).
using built-in modules effectively.
the main thing how to write ,test and debug the code and transfer the code to local development and make it work correctly.

# How I Tested My Code:
I tested the logic of the code first in an online code editor and then copied the code to time_tick_quiz.py and ran it in the terminal inside the virtual environment.
verified that:
questions displayed correctly ,timer counted down properly, thread allowed simultaneous input and countdown,requests fetched data successfully from external API,built-in modules like json worked correctly.
I ran the game multiple times to check everything was correct. 
The task was good as it required so much of learning about so many new conepts and i am really happy with the knowledge i got after completing this task.
