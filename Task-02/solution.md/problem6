#Remove card

problem statement: Find the minimum number of moves required so that all the cards remaining on the table have the same number written on them.  
In one move, you can remove any card.

Approach: count the frequency of each number on the cards. keep the number with the maximum frequency.
minimum moves = total cards-maximum frequency.

code:
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    N=int(input())
    cards=list(map(int,input().split()))
    freq={}
    for num in cards:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num]+=1
        else:
            freq[num]=1
             
    maximum_freq=max(freq.values())
    moves=N-maximum_freq
    print(moves)
