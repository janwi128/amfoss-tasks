/*
Approach:
This tool counts lines, words, and characters in a file, similar to the wc command. 
I used fgetc to process each character and added logic to detect word boundaries.

Challenges/Bugs:
A challenge was ensuring correct word countingâ€”especially when there were multiple spaces. 
I solved it by using a flag (in_word) to track when we are inside or outside a word.

What I learned:
I learned about character-level file reading and how to implement logic for word counting.
