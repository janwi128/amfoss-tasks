# Amfoss-tasks
# INTRODUCTION
Myself Janwi yadav, I am a first-year B.Tech computer science and Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I am an enthusiastic learner with a strong interest in exploring technology, i know begineer level coding in python. My hobbies include playing badminton, reading books and listening to music. I am eager to learn grow and take up challenges that will sharpen my technical and collaborative skills.
# Why should we coose you ?
I believe and follow the ultimate four words in my life "I DO IT ANYWAYS" even if i am afraid of rejection, failure , no good resluts- I put into my 100% efforts and just stay committed with my hardwork and never give up. Duirng praveshan tasks , I've given my best by showing up everyday no matter what and this sums up all my hardwork, dedication, consistency and discipline towards my task. I am also highly adaptable ,quick to learn and i can pick up new tools, technologies and skills as required. I am confident that choosing me would not just add a motivated learner to the club, but someone with a never-give-up attitude, someone who is willing to grow with the community and contribute back consistently overtime with pleasure.
# How do you intend to contribute back to the club ?
I am going to be an active participant in discusssions, projects and events hosted by the club - not just for my own growth but also to add value to the collective work of the team. Teamwork is something i value deeply and i will ensure that we grow together as a group whether it's dividing responsibilities, brainstorming solutions or stepping up to help when challenges arise. I also see the club as a long-term commitment, not something i would leave after a month when things get hard, I want to grow with club over-time and dedicate my hardwork and time into this club. I will be actively participating in competitions and technical events where i will proudly represent amFOSS, showcasing the skills, teamwork and innovation i will gain here.
# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them ?
I am deeply interested in several areas of technology that excite me both academically and creatively. I want to deeply explore how web applications are built, from front-end design to back-end logic and for that i plan to satrt by learning HTML,CSS and JavaScipt. Mobile apps have always fascinated me and i aim to learn android development too. I'm also interested in contributing to real-world projects, by working on open-source contribiutions ,I will gain hands-on experience. Strong fundamentals are backbone of any tech field and i am committed to regularly practicing coding problems, improving my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
# What are your thoughts and feedback on the praveshan selection process ?
The praveshan tasks were truly amazing and challenging - When i first saw them, i never thought i would make it this far as a complete begineer. Before starting, I was a completely different person, but through these tasks i learned concepts in weeks that would have taken months otherwise and this journey has transformed me. I am deeply thankful to my mentors for their guidance and for designing such a process that not only test skills but also teaches persistence, problem-solving and logical thinking skills. I sincerely hope to be selected in amFOSS , but even if i am not , i am proud of how much i have learned and grown during this journey. The only thing that makes me a little sad is that despite giving my best, i could not complete all 10 tasks - yet i carry forward the lessons, confidence and determination i gained along the way. No matter the result, this experience will remain very special to me as the first big step in my journey into technology.
