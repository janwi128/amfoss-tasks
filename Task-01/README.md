APPROACH:
 firstly i knew nothing about terminal commands and git so, at first i learned some basic terminal and git commands and how they work.
 
 part-1
 I used cd and ls in this part to navigate to Earth/Russsia/Vladimir_Oblast and i got the first key inside the gravity_equation.txt .
 
 part-2
Here I used cd ,ls -a to navigate to saturn/ring and then used chmod to execute the hidden file .wormhole.sh and  got my second key.

part-3
this part was really time-consuming as i searched inside all the directories and finally found the third key inside .HABITABLE.txt .
I first switch branches by using git branch -a and git switch then I used cd and ls -a to navigate to Edmunds_planet/Desert5/.hidden_cave/.hidden_branch and found the genetic code.

part-4
In this part i again used cd and ls -a to navigate to Gargantua/.the_core and found the .message_from_Them.txt , i found some binary code and then decoded it to get my final key and then finally i arranged all the keys for decoding  and got my final message.

Now, I have successfully completed the task . The Amount of Happiness I got after completing the task is Unexplainable. This  was one of my best experiences working with this task to learn something new ,THANKS TO PRAVESHAN.
