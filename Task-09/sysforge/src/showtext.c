/*
Approach:
I used fopen, fgets, and fclose
to open and read files line by line, then print their contents to the terminal. I added 
support for reading multiple files.

Challenges/Bugs:
At first, my code didnâ€™t compile because I had a typo error.
Another issue was implementing for handling multiple files properly was a bit difficult, which I fixed by using a loop over argv.

What I learned:
I practiced file handling in C, including reading line by line and error-checking when 
a file doesn't exist.
